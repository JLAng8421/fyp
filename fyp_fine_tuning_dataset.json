Learning disabilities like dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia affect specific academic skills and vary in severity. Intellectual disabilities also have a wide range, from individuals who need support for daily living to those who can live independently. Cerebral palsy varies from mild motor challenges to severe physical impairments."
